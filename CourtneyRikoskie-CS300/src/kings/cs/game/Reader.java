/**
 * This class is part of the "Cat" application. "Cat" is a
 * text-based adventure game.
 * 
 * This parser reads user input and tries to interpret it as an "Adventure"
 * command. Every time it is called it reads a line from the terminal and tries
 * to interpret the line as a two word command. It returns the command as an
 * object of class Command.
 * 
 * The parser has a set of known command words. It checks user input against the
 * known commands, and if the input is not one of the known commands, it returns
 * a command object that is marked as an unknown command.
